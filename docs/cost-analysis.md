## Cost Components

### Primary Cost Drivers
1. AWS Lambda execution time and requests
2. API Gateway requests
3. DynamoDB read/write operations
4. CloudFront data transfer
5. S3 storage and requests

### Regional Cost Comparison
Cost comparison will be performed for:
- eu-west-1 (Ireland)
- eu-central-1 (Frankfurt)
- eu-north-1 (Stockholm)

## Cost Optimization Recommendations

*Top three cost optimization opportunities will be documented here after analysis.*

## Budget Monitoring

AWS Budget is configured to monitor costs based on the Service tag filter with alerts for cost thresholds.
