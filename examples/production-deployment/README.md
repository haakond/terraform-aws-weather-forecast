# Production Deployment Example

This example demonstrates a production-ready deployment of the Weather Forecast App with enhanced monitoring, alerting, and operational features.

## Production Features

- ✅ Enhanced monitoring and alerting
- ✅ SNS notifications for critical events
- ✅ Extended log retention (180 days)
- ✅ Higher budget limits for production traffic
- ✅ Additional CloudWatch alarms
- ✅ Comprehensive tagging strategy
- ✅ Operational dashboards and console links

## Usage

1. **Prepare your configuration**:
   ```bash
   cp -r examples/production-deployment my-prod-weather-app
   cd my-prod-weather-app
   ```

2. **Configure production variables**:
   Create a `terraform.tfvars` file:
   ```hcl
   project_name    = "weather-forecast-app"
   environment     = "prod"
   aws_region      = "eu-west-1"
   company_website = "mycompany.com"
   budget_limit    = 100
   owner          = "Platform Team"
   cost_center    = "Engineering"
   alert_email    = "alerts@mycompany.com"
   ```

3. **Initialize and deploy**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

## Production Considerations

### Security
- All resources follow least privilege IAM principles
- CloudFront provides DDoS protection
- API Gateway includes rate limiting
- All data encrypted in transit and at rest

### Monitoring
- **CloudWatch Dashboards**: Application and cost monitoring
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Lambda errors, API Gateway 5xx, DynamoDB throttling
- **SNS Alerts**: Email notifications for critical issues
- **Budget Alerts**: Cost threshold notifications

### High Availability
- Multi-AZ deployment for Lambda functions
- CloudFront global edge locations
- DynamoDB with point-in-time recovery
- API Gateway with built-in redundancy

### Performance
- CloudFront CDN for global content delivery
- DynamoDB on-demand scaling
- Lambda reserved concurrency to prevent cold starts
- 1-hour caching to minimize API calls

## Expected Production Costs

Monthly cost estimates for different usage levels:

| Usage Level | API Calls/Month | Estimated Cost |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Low         | 10K            | $15-25 USD     |
| Medium      | 100K           | $25-50 USD     |
| High        | 1M             | $50-100 USD    |

### Cost Breakdown
- **Lambda**: $5-20 (execution time and requests)
- **API Gateway**: $3-15 (API calls)
- **DynamoDB**: $2-10 (read/write requests)
- **CloudFront**: $1-5 (data transfer)
- **S3**: $1-3 (storage and requests)
- **CloudWatch**: $2-5 (logs and metrics)

## Operational Runbook

### Daily Operations
1. Check CloudWatch dashboard for anomalies
2. Review cost dashboard for unexpected charges
3. Monitor alert notifications

### Weekly Operations
1. Review CloudWatch logs for errors
2. Check budget utilization
3. Validate backup and recovery procedures

### Monthly Operations
1. Review and optimize costs
2. Update dependencies and security patches
3. Performance analysis and optimization

### Incident Response
1. **High Error Rate**: Check CloudWatch logs and Lambda metrics
2. **High Latency**: Review API Gateway and Lambda performance
3. **Cost Alerts**: Investigate usage patterns and optimize
4. **API Failures**: Check external weather API status

## Monitoring URLs

After deployment, access these operational dashboards:

- **Application Dashboard**: CloudWatch dashboard for app metrics
- **Cost Dashboard**: CloudWatch dashboard for cost monitoring
- **API Gateway Console**: AWS console for API management
- **Lambda Console**: AWS console for function monitoring
- **CloudFront Console**: AWS console for CDN management

## Scaling Considerations

The application automatically scales with demand:
- **Lambda**: Scales to handle concurrent requests
- **API Gateway**: Handles high request volumes
- **DynamoDB**: On-demand scaling for read/write capacity
- **CloudFront**: Global edge locations for performance

## Disaster Recovery

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: < 1 hour
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: < 1 hour
- **Backup Strategy**: DynamoDB point-in-time recovery
- **Multi-Region**: Can be deployed in multiple regions

## Clean Up

To remove all production resources:
```bash
terraform destroy
```

**⚠️ Warning**: This will permanently delete all resources and data.

## Next Steps

- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- Configure custom domain name with Route 53
- Implement blue-green deployment strategy
- Set up cross-region disaster recovery
